This project is the a typical starting project concerning object detection.
I started by annotating multiple F-35 images on Roboflow. Than generated an dataset and extracted it to my computer.
Afterwards I added my personal Lightning II pics to the validation dataset to check how well it works.
At later stages I uploaded more images, mostly of F/A-18 and F-2000 and trained the desired model again.
I believe in the future more aircraft will be added to the dataset, especially fighter jets...
Everything has been done on YOLOv8 object detection model.

Future updates might involve training it on another military hardware, probably even ground vehicles etc... 
(just to receive best possible outcome for detection purposes concerining all possible threats...)
