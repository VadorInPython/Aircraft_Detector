This project is the a typical starting project concerning object detection.
I started by annotating multiple F-35 images on Roboflow. Than generated an dataset and extracted it to my computer.
Afterwards I added my personal Lightning II pics to the validation dataset to check how well it works.
I believe in the future more aircraft will be added to the dataset, especially fighter jets...
Everything has been done on YOLOv8 object detection model.
